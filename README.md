# Glenforsa Airfield

Glenforsa Airfield is an unlicensed grass airfield on the Isle of Mull (Scotland, United Kingdom). It is a beautiful little airfield and the scenery around the islands and Scotland in general is always stunning and a fun place to fly.

* 4x GA parking spots
* Static aircraft around the parking spots
* Fences and Windsocks added
* Added 3x boats onto the Sound of Mull
* Additional vegetation
* Watch out for the geese (If anyone knows how I can get these to move, please do let me know)

# Version Changelog
v1.1 (Released 2nd Sept 2020)
